# Quantum_ML_Model

This is the implementation of the project **Underwater Marine Animmal Classification** using Quantum CNN with the help of hybrid models RESNET50,RESNET18 and INCEPTION model.
This project was completely build under the **CODERED Hackathon** which was hosted at BMSIT - 2024.
Our state-of-the-art system marries the power of classical deep learning and quantum computation, utilizing ResNet-50 and Inception Net enhanced with quantum layers for superior underwater animal classification. we are using ImageDataGenerator is a tool that helps us create more examples of images to train our computer model.The innovative integration of qubits allows complex pattern detection beyond classical constraints. To ensure robustness, we employ dropout strategies before the final dense layer that determines the most accurate classification from 23 classes. Complementing this, we've embedded a GPT-2-based chatbot, enriched with knowledge of marine life, to interactively provide users with detailed, approachable information about the classified species. This synthesis of quantum-augmented neural networks and AI-driven communication offers an unparalleled user experience in the marine domain.
Other than the Image classification our project is furthur also providing the information about the classified marine animal and also We are showcasing the the location where is available the most with complete location and place name with latitude and longitude information.
